# rock-paper-scissors
This repository is for the first JavaScript assignment and is part of The Odin Project Curriculum.

This game is part of The Odin Project (TOP) curriculum. To find out more about TOP, you can click [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/). This game is played completely in the Google Chrome developer tools console. When prompted by invoking the game(); function, the user is asked to input 5 rounds of guesses within the scope of:

1. rock
2. paper
3. scissors

The game will print to the console who won each round, and who the final winner was. The main objective of this project was to practice basic Javascript skills.
